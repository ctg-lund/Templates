To whom it may concern!

This is a friendly reminder to let us know **immediately** once you have downloaded your data from our delivery server!

As a rule, you should try to download your data within **one week** of receiving your delivery email.

**Data buildup in the delivery server is a main source of delays**, as we always try to confirm that you have retrieved your data before
we clear the space!

 **Your raw data** will always be kept for **1 month (Sequencing Only)** or **3 months for our other projects**
at our secure HPC, which is a separate system from our delivery server for security reasons.

Best,
CTG/CGLU Staff
