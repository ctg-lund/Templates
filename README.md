# Templates

## Delivery
Note regarding delivery guide: currently replaced manually by copying it over /srv/data/ctgstaff/ctg-delivery-guide-v1.1.pdf
We are rebuilding the delivery process and will probably get the template directly from here in the future!

## PEP
Portable encapsulated projects (PEPs) are a way of storing biological sampledata along with metadata in a human and machine friendly manner. 

A PEP is used to receive data from customers and is then returned back to the customer along with any additional annotations that might be important.
